For more advanced gym go-ers the Legs-Pull-Push might be preferable, it requires more time but can allow you to focus more on the details of your physique, and can be useful for gaining strength if performed as primary lift strength work (squat, deadlift, bench) followed by relevant accesory movements.\nMany of the great aesthetic physiques were built using the Full Body split, it's the one I use.\n\nNote to women:\nTraining for muscle gain and strength can be a very enjoyable and rewarding experience, some are afraid that they might get 'too big' but this is highly unlikely as it would take years of intensive training to get what some might consider 'too big'.

Other presets are to be done as stand-alone stretching sessions.\nPost-exercise stretching provides a moment to allow the heart rate to return to its resting state, and for the muscles and the mind to relax, it is important however to perform a light warm-down (cardio) before stretching.\nStretching in general can improve flexibility and mental health, reduce risk of injury, and improve circulation and muscle co-ordination. ";
        "bodyTextStretching" = "Stretching the muscles that you have worked can aid recovery and muscle health; as you have been contracting the muscles throughout the exercise they have become shorter, tighter and remain somewhat contracted, therefore stretching them out relaxes them and restores their length. Stretching the muscles also aids blood circulation and thus muscle recovery. Unlike pre-exercise/warm up stretching (that consists mainly of dynamic stretching), post-workout stretching is generally static as this provides time for the muscles to elongate.\nStretching is important not just post exercise, but also the next day and as stand alone sessions (these can take the form of yoga, but I have also included non yoga specific sessions in this stretching section).\nStretching can lead to better posture directly after having been performed which can be benefitial in allowing the muscles to recover in their correct positions. Stretching can also lead to better posture in the long term.";
        "mindTextStretching" = "Stretching is also an opportunity to actively relax the mind and train it to accept uncomfortable situations. Stretching is often not a pleasant experience to begin with, but as you stretch more it shifts from unpleasant, to acceptable, to practically enjoyable, thus is an excellent teacher for the mind. This shift is initiated by your mental state during the stretching, it is important to relax into the stretch, feeling and being completely aware of the sensation without forming any conscious opinions of it thus allowing it simply to be no more than a sensation (which your mind eventually gets used to). Realise that the discomfort is a result of a chemical reaction in your brain and body, and learn to control the effect of it on your mind. Relaxing into the stretch is done through breathing, breath in deeply, then relax and lean into the stretch as you breath out, repeat this until you are in a position where you have a deep stretch (that isn't forced), and continue breathing into the stretch, each breath out relaxing and accepting the sensation more.\nWhen you're stretching try not to put too much energy into any one thought, I find myself in a meditative state in which I watch my thoughts go by and am aware of everything around me (thoughts and physical space) without focusing on anything in particular.\nVisualisation of the muscles elongating can also be a good technique as this increases the mind muscle connection and allows you to relax the muscles better.\nStretching also improves the general health of your brain in the long term if performed consistenly and properly.\n\nNotes:\nIf you don't have time to stretch after your workout, perform at least 5min of light cardio for cool-down and try to stretch before bed.\nIt is important to note that caution is required and that you should stretch with good form and to your abilities. This avoids the possibitly of overstretching or stretchingx in such a way that does more harm than good. Don't force any stretch, this will not speed up your progress; hold the stretches in positions where you have good resistance, and when breathing out to increase the stretch only increase by tiny amounts and stop where you can stretch no furthur without forcing. Stop immeditely if pain or excessive discomfort become apparent (usually a sudden or sharp pain indicates an issue).\nWarming up before stand alone stretching sessions is important, this can take the form of 5min of light cardio or some dynamic stretches; the 'full-body' section under 'warm up' includes a warm up for stretching sessions.\nThe order in which you stretch is important, and the order presented here is thought out.\nThis section includes primarily static stretching where you hold in the maximum stretched position for a length of time, it is also possible to turn static stretches into isomeric stretches. An isomeric stretch is one in which you contract the muscle being stretched whilst in passive stretching position, then relaxing after 15s for 15-30s. Isomeric stretches can be useful as it stretches a greater portion of the muscle fibres in the muscle being stretched. They can however easily be done in a counterproductive manner, so I would only suggest them to people who already have had experience with them and understand a little about them. If you are interested in other stretching techniques, I suggest you look into PNF stretching (generally done with a partner) which is intermittent isomeric then static stretching and can lead to significant flexibility increases if done correctly.\nSelf massage is also a good technique during cooldown and stretching sessions.";

// Introduction
"introductionGE" = "Meditation brings a wide variety of benefits, ranging from contentedness to an increased ability to concentrate. With a little practice it will become natural and you will be able to explore its effects and benefits.\n\nI consider it important to become independent in meditation in order to get the most out of it. By independent I mean to have developed a number of techniques, recognised their effects on yourself, and to have the ability to practice them without aid. The introduction section therefore serves to explain the fundamentals and to get you started, whilst the other sections present a variety of techniques to explore.\n\nThe meditation techniques presented are:\n1. Focused Meditation: meditation with our attention directed towards an object (e.g breath)\n2. Mindfulness: meditation with our attention being entirely in the present (perhaps on an object) whilst remaining aware of passing thoughts and emotions.\n\nDon’t be daunted if at first you find it difficult to meditate, and make sure you are not too hard on yourself – this would be counter-productive; learning how to meditate takes time. It is best to relax and not to force the mind to do what you want it to, but rather to encourage it in the right direction and to keep on trying.\n\nPosture/eyes:\nIt is common to practice meditation in a seated posture, cross legged, with a straight and tall back, or to meditate on a chair with your feet on the ground, and your back sitting tall (or even lying on the floor).\nIt can be helpful to start meditating with your eyes closed, as this can help avoid distractions.\n\nContinue on to the introduction section for the first meditation practice.";
"introduction1E" = "Focused Meditation, Breathing:\n\nThis meditation technique can be described as the taming of your monkey mind. Your monkey mind represents the general noise and chatter of the brain, and focused meditation aims at developing the ability to sit above this, calming it, and being present in the moment with our attention not wandering. It entails giving a simple job to the monkey mind, a meditation object to observe, for example your breath. This object should be observed and relaxed into. The difficulty in the beginning is keeping to this object without getting distracted. Often as a beginner your mind will wander off and do other things, thus it is important to learn to see when this is happening and to bring your mind back to the object. Bells are useful as a reminder to return your awareness to the object.\n\nI recommend you perform this meditation a number of times in order to learn to meditate upon your breath as this ability is very useful, and can be practised whenever and wherever to great benefit (even 30s of meditating on your breath is deeply beneficial). You can tailor the meditation with the choices above.\n\nPractice:\nThis meditation practice is short, and the meditation object will be your breath. Correct breathing entails breathing into your stomach, that is to say not deliberately expanding your chest, but rather your stomach (as you will then be using the diaphragm correctly).\n\n• Sit comfortably and upright, with good posture\n• Close your eyes\n• Take deep, slow and relaxed breaths into your stomach (aim for 4s or more)\n• Listen to the sound of your breath, feel the movement of air, be conscious of how your body reacts to inhaling and exhaling\n• At every bell, ensure your awareness is as described above";
"introduction2E" = "Focused Meditation, Visualisation/Observation:\n\nPreviously we took our breath as our meditation object, here we will extend this and take an image (we can visualise an object (Visualisation) or observe a physical one (Observation)). The aim is to get a clear picture in our mind of the object we are meditating on, to reach a calm state with our focus on this object, and to observe it neutrally. Breathing is very useful in achieving this goal. We can begin by observing our breath until a calm state has been reached, then introduce our object as our main focus, whilst still 'sitting' upon our breath, that is to say remaining aware of the breathing whilst our focus is directed towards the object.\n\nVisualisation:\nThe object we visualise is not necessarily static, for example it can be something that moves with the breath, and not necessarily small, it could be a large object and we could watch or focus shift around this object. The choice of object changes the benefits of the meditation - for a relaxing meditation we could choose an image of nature; a tree, a mountain, a stream etc. Colours are also very good to visualize. Seeing as the effects differ for each person, it is good to try a number of objects to experience their effect and to learn which object to choose when.\n\nObservation:\nObserving an object neutrally whilst being aware of our breath is very meditative (and especially good for those that find it difficult to visualise objects). It can be very useful in becoming more mindful throughout the day as it helps develop the ability to neutrally observe things.\nObservational meditation can be extended to observing a sound, for example the sound of trees in the wind, of a stream, of rain. This can be extremely relaxing. It can also be practised when on a walk and especially beginners can benefit greatly from it, as the object on which you are meditating changes continuously\n\nPractice:\nIn this practice we will choose a simple object relating to nature (e.g. a tree). The practice should be performed at least twice (not necessarily in succession), once visualising the object, once observing it (and can be tried again observing a sound).\n\n• Sit comfortably and upright, with good posture\n• Close your eyes (if visualising)\n• Take deep, slow and relaxed breaths into your stomach (aim for 4s or more)• Relax into your breath until a calm state is reached\n• Begin to focus on your object\n• Remain aware of your breath\n• Become aware of different features of the object without using words to describe them\n• At every bell, ensure you are focusing on the object, whilst remaining aware of your breath";
"introduction3E" = "Focused Meditation, Abstract Thought:\n\nThis is similar to the Visualisation/Observation meditation, except here we will take an abstract subject (thought, idea, emotion). The aim is to develop a clear image of this subject, focusing upon it, thinking about it in different ways and from different angles. This style of meditation can be very useful in developing specific traits of ourselves, for example being more calm, increasing contentedness, becoming more patient or forgiving.\nA wandering mind is useful as long as the mind keeps its wandering thoughts focused upon the chosen subject.\nBreathing is again very important; we begin by observing our breathing and once in a meditative state we introduce our object as our main focus. Remaining aware of our breath throughout the session can increase our ability to focus on the subject. Whenever we catch ourselves wandering, we can return to our breath, then to the subject.\nExample: the subject could be a goal of yours - e.g. becoming more patient - and you could meditate on the process of achieving this goal, refining this goal, what you hope to get out of this goals etc.\n\nPractice:\nIn this practice choose a goal you wish to achieve\n\n• Sit comfortably and upright, with good posture\n• Close your eyes\n• Take deep, slow and relaxed breaths into your stomach (aim for 4s or more)\n• Relax into your breath until a calm state is reached\n• Begin to focus on your goal\n• Refine the idea of the goal, what it is you wish to achieve and what it is you wish to get out of this goal\n• Remain aware of your breath whilst focusing on your object\n• Think about the process of achieving this goal, and about the intricacies of doing so\n• Continue thinking about different aspect of the goal, allowing your mind to wander on the subject\n• At every bell, ensure you are focusing on your goal";
"introduction4E" = "Mindfulness:\n\nMindfulness entails being entirely in the moment, having one’s attention focused on the present, being aware of what surrounds you, what you feel, and what you think. Breathing is very important, as it is a continual process that is always happening in the present moment, it is useful to observe this while we practice mindfulness, as it roots us in the present moment, even if we merely remain aware of it rather than solely focusing on it. With our roots set in the present moment through our awareness of breathing, we can then observe other aspects of the present moment; from thoughts and emotions to sights and sounds. This can be a very useful skill in enhancing and helping any activity we are performing. It is a skill that cannot just be used during a specific meditation practice, but throughout our daily lives (see mindfullness lessons in lessons section).\n\nPractice:\nThe first steps in mindfulness will be to neutrally observe your thoughts, without developing them, remaining entirely in the present by watching your breathing.\n\n• Sit comfortably and upright, with good posture\n• Close your eyes\n• Take deep, slow and relaxed breaths into your stomach (aim for 4s or more)\n• Relax into your breath until a calm state is reached\n• Allow your mind to wander, whilst remaining aware of your breath (watch your thoughts as you would clouds passing in the sky)\n• At every bell, ensure you are still aware of your breath";



"squareBreathingE" = "Square Breathing (Breath retention/Khumbaka):\n\nSquare breathing means following a square breathing pattern:\n\n• Breathe in for X seconds\n• Hold for X seconds\n• Breathe out for X seconds\n• Hold for X seconds\n• Repeat\n\nBegin with X = 4s and adjust to your abilities (I use X = 5s). The key is not so much the length of X but rather the fact that X always remains constant. It is important to focus your awareness on your breath, and pay attention to carefully counting regular seconds. This technique can be particularly useful in a short meditation e.g. to reduce stress, focus, or clear your mind. 5 minutes will have you feeling very calm if you relax into your breath and become fully aware of the breath whilst carefully counting.";
"breathCountingE" = "Breath Counting:\n\nAs the name suggests, this meditation is counting the number of breaths you take.\n\nFirst fix a number (e.g 50)\n• Breathe in slowly and surely into your stomach (aim for 4s or more)\n• Be entirely aware of your breathing\n• Count each breath (1 breath = 1 inhale and 1 exhale)\n• When you reach fixed number, return your count to 0 and restart.\n\nThis ensures you are focused on your breath, and that your mind is given a simple task that requires a minimum level of concentration so as to not loose count, and to realise when you have reached the number.\nThis technique can be very good for clearing your mind, as you are required to use just enough cognitive power to avoid the excessive wandering of the mind, and can also increase your ability to focus, as you are practicing this skill in the simple task of counting breaths.\n\nTo extend this technique you could use visualisation, imagining a progress bar that fills in as you get closer to the goal, or to visualise a counter of the number of breaths that increases each breath, without you actively saying the next number, rather simply seeing it (this is rather difficult and requires some practice).";
"purgingE" = "Purging:\n\nIn this technique, your aim is to purge carbon dioxide from the body. This method is excellent for clearing the mind.\n\n• Lay down on your back\n• Take 30 purging breaths: Purging breaths being quick breaths in which you take a rapid and deep inhale, then exhale as fast as possible (hyperventilation).\n• On the final breath inhale deeply and slowly. Then let the air out of your lungs as slowly as you can, then hold your breath until you have the gasp reflex\n• Inhale deeply again once and hold your breath for 10 seconds\n• Relax, breathe freely and enjoy the feeling\n• Repetition is possible, but for no more than a few times (don’t go over what feels comfortable)\n\nNote: In your first attempts you should perform gentle purging breaths, as you can feel dizzy which might be uncomfortable if you are not used to it.";
"nostrilBreathingE" = "Alternate Nostril Breathing:\n\nIn this method you change the nostril you breathe through with every breath.\n\n• Place your index and middle fingers between your eyebrows\n• You will use your thumb and your ring finger to alternately block your nostrils\n• Block your left nostril with your ring finger\n• Inhale in deeply into your stomach, then exhale (aim for 4s or more per breath)\n• Release your left nostril and block your right one with your thumb\n• Inhale deeply into your stomach, then exhale (aim again for 4s or more)\n• Repeat the nostril breathing\n\nThis method has many variations. You can for example count your breath or practice square breathing. Square breathing then works as follows:\n\n• Breathe in through one nostril\n• Close both and hold\n• Breathe out through the other\n• Close both and hold\n• Repeat\n\nThis results in your always breathing in through one and out through another, so you should swap directions either halfway through your practice or after each cycle.";
// Visualisation
"bodyScanE" = "Body Scan:\n\nThis technique can induce deep relaxation, and can be used to help you get to sleep. It also increases your mind’s connection with your body, that is to say you become more aware of how your body feels. It is focused meditation with your meditation object being your body. Throughout the session you should continue being aware of your breath in order to keep yourself in the present. You then focus on different parts of your body one after the other and observe the feeling of each part. A structured exploration of the body is useful; here is an example:\n\n• Lie down on your back (on a hard floor can be pleasant) and close your eyes\n• Breathe deeply into your stomach (aim for 4s or more)\n• Focus on being aware of your breath\n• Once relaxed - and while still remaining aware of your breath - you will now shift your focus to various parts of your body. While focusing on one body part you should become aware of different aspects of what it feels like. Explore these feelings, but try to do so without using words\n• Begin with your legs, focusing first on the toes and moving up to the hips exploring different specific parts of the legs (toes, ankles, feet, calves, knees etc.), then the legs as a whole\n• Move on to your arms, beginning at the fingers and moving to the shoulders exploring different specific parts (fingers, palms, wrist, forearm, elbow etc.)\n• Move on to your torso, beginning at your pelvis and moving up to your lower neck exploring different specific parts (pelvis, stomach, chest etc.), then the torso as a whole, then the torso, arms and legs together\n• Finally move on to your neck and head, starting at the neck and moving up to the top of your head exploring different parts (neck, chin, cheeks, nose, eyes, ears etc.), then your head as a whole, then your entire body.\n\nThe length of the practice will depend on the amount of body parts you explore, and the detail with which you explore each body part. Having a main structure is useful, here is my favourite described again more concisely:\n\n• Legs (specific)\n• Legs (whole)\n• Arms (specific)\n• Arms (whole)\n• Torso (specific)\n• Torso (whole)\n• Torso, arms, and legs\n• Head (specific)\n• Head (whole)\n• Whole body";

There is a skill to be learned in setting ourselves a goal, deciding without question to achieve it so that we are fully committed, then simply being aware of our breathing and allowing ourselves to give maximum effort and achieve this goal. The goal can be anything, a workout, a run, stretching, getting a tough job done, literally anything. The key here is to have made an absolute decision to achieve this goal, and then to not force it in any way (i.e. not to have the feeling 'I have to'), simply to relax and have the confidence that we can achieve it, and watch our breath while we do exactly that (i.e. the feeling 'I will do'). It may take some practice to develop this skill, but once understood, it becomes our best friend.";
"Test" = "Mindfulness in yoga, sport and life,   focus on breathing and allow yourself to give maximum effort, rather that focusing on giving maximum effort. You make the decision to give maximum effort, and once this decision has been made simply observe it happenning, while focusing on your breath.\n\nThis skill can be extended into all aspects of life, you simply make an absolute decision, then observe yourself fullfill this decision, entirely in the moment whilst being aware of your breath";

"effortLesson" = "Making an effort does not necessarily need to be a forceful act, that is to say it does necessarily require you to strain your mind. There is an art to setting yourself a goal, fully committing to it and then simply watching yourself achieve it.\nThe keys here are the acts of:\n1. Fully committing to the task at hand.\n2. Watching yourself achieve this goal.\n\n1. Fully committing means to make a concious, reasoned decision that you're going to acheive this goal. It is important not to leave open the option of failure without having put all you can into it, and so if the idea of giving up enters your mind no reasoning is required, you can simply drop it. When the mind is fatigued, strained or unmotivated requires simple, clear instructions to follow; having commited yourself to your goal you have given yourself exactly this, a simple, clear instruction.\n\n2. Mindfulness is an important skill when watching yourself achieve the goal. In mindful meditation you remain aware of your breath, whilst allowing your attention to be taken by other thoughts and events in passing (like watching clouds drift by). It is important to always remain aware of your breath, and to return your focus to it whenever your mind wanders off. When achieving a goal we can do exactly this, remain aware of our breath whilst allowing our mind to focus on different aspects of the goal we are trying to achieve. If any negative idea of failure or giving up enters our mind, or any distraction at all, we can return our focus entirely to our breath to clear the mind of these thoughts, thereby allowing us to put in maximal effort without straining. Focus on your breathing and allow yourself to give maximum effort, rather than focusing on giving maximum effort.";

"breathingWorkoutLesson" = "Breathing is very important in Fitness; it is vital for correct core activation, helps with keeping focused on the task and keeping a good rythm, and can help you give your all.\n\n1. Working out:\nAn important factor in working out is 'time under tension', that is to say the amount of time your muscles are being used in a movement. When doing more repititions we are simply increasing that 'time under tension'. It is good therefore to perform most movements relatively slowly and in a controlled manner. Taking deep breaths, one breath per repitition, is perfect (it may seem too slow at first but is got used to quickly).\n\n The general rules are:\n1. Breathe in during eccentric movement (when your are preparing to push hard/lowering a weight, e.g going down in a squat).\n2. Breathe out during concentric movement (when your are pushing hard/lifting a weight, e.g pushing back up in a squat).\nNote: The eccentric movement (lowering a weight/contracting when lengthening a muscle), is especially important as it is a main cause for muscle growth (and soreness!) and should be performed in a slow, controlled manner.\n\nTaking deep controlled breaths in fitnesss also helps with putting in maximum effort (see lesson on effort).\n\n2. Cardio/Endurance:\nBreathing correctly during cardiovascular activity is especially important for maintaining good core activation (see lesson on core activation), and therefore good posture. Good posture can mean reducing wasted energy and keeping a healthier position for our muscles and joints. Again breathing also helps in giving maximum effort, we can focus our mind on the breathing and be aware of the cardio rather than focusing entirely on the cardio.";
"breathingYogaLesson" = "Yoga goes hand in hand with mindfulness meditation. In mindful meditation you remain aware of your breath, whilst allowing your attention to be taken by other thoughts and events in passing (like watching clouds drift by). With yoga we remain aware of our breath, taking deep slow and controlled breaths, and allow our attention to wander to different aspects of the feeling of the pose we are in.\nTry not to analyse the feeling of each pose with words, just become aware of the physical feeling and breathe into each pose.\n\nThe general rules are:\n1. Exhale when bending forwards/stretching into a pose.\n2. Inhale when lifting/opening the chest (bending backwards).\n3. Exhale when twisting.";
"coreActivationLesson" = "Core activation is vital for anything from fitness to yoga to simply keeping a good posture. Your core muscles and found mostly around the belly and the mid to lower back (they are not just your abs but do include them). Keeping an active core implies keeping constant tension throughout the core, but not necessarily always tensing forcefully.\nBreathing whilst keeping an active core is an extremely important skill.\nA good way to get a good idea of what core activation feels like is to do a plank.\nPracticing breathing in a plank is good training.\n\nBreathing in plank:\n1. Get into the plank position and take deep, controlled breaths\n2. On each inhale, breathe into your stomach but resist this movement a little with your core muscles. Try also to lift your head away from your pelvis during the inhale.\n3. On each exhale, slowly activate your core muscles and push your breath out with this activation.\n\nCore Activation\n1. Stand tall and upright.\n2. Breath deeply.\n3. When exhaling, try and push the air out with your core muscles (around your torso, as if your had a corset squeezing you), but remain standing tall and upright (your lower back muscles, also part of the core, should be activated to help do so).\n4. When inhaling, breath deeply into your stomach, but resist the expansion of your stomatch/torso area a little with your core muscles.\n\nThese are excellent exercises for learning to activate your core.\n\nNote on posture:\nAs we sit so much our cores are not supporting us as they should. Therefore learning to activate your core with these breathing exercises, and performing them when sitting down, will greatly help your posture.\nStrengthening the core through fitness and cardio is important, but so is keeping good posture throughout the day. Trying to sit and stand upright, breathing into the stomach, and absolutely avoiding excessive learning on arms/elbows is equally important.";
