With each new set, move the foam roller furthur up your thoracic spine 10-15cm or to another position that seems fit (that feels it could benifit from stretching).\n\nNotes:\nKeep your neck in a comfortable neutral position.\nYour arms can be in any position (where your elbows are in front of your chest not out to the side) that does not cause pain or discomfort, here are some suggestions:\n- With your palms facing towards you and your hand touching, bring your elbows close together and place your palms just behind the top of your head so that your elbows are close to your forehead (without pulling your head up with your arms)\n- Hold your elbows or your shoulders and point your elbows up, perpendicular to your chest.\n- Place your hands somewhere on your chest area and relax your elbows so they are close to your torso.\n\n\nPurpose:\nFoam rolling loosens the muscles and warms them up in preperation for the warm up and exercise, it also increases blood flow to the rolled area.

Hold for 1s then return gently to the starting position.\nProceed to slowly round your back up towards the ceiling and relax the back of your neck so your head stretches towards the ground (cat pose) without forcing it towards your chin, gravity will do the work.

Other presets are to be done as stand-alone stretching sessions.\nPost-exercise stretching provides a moment to allow the heart rate to return to its resting state, and for the muscles and the mind to relax, it is important however to perform a light warm-down (cardio) before stretching.\nStretching in general can improve flexibility and mental health, reduce risk of injury, and improve circulation and muscle co-ordination. ";
        "bodyTextStretching" = "Stretching the muscles that you have worked can aid recovery and muscle health; as you have been contracting the muscles throughout the exercise they have become shorter, tighter and remain somewhat contracted, therefore stretching them out relaxes them and restores their length. Stretching the muscles also aids blood circulation and thus muscle recovery. Unlike pre-exercise/warm up stretching (that consists mainly of dynamic stretching), post-workout stretching is generally static as this provides time for the muscles to elongate.\nStretching is important not just post exercise, but also the next day and as stand alone sessions (these can take the form of yoga, but I have also included non yoga specific sessions in this stretching section).\nStretching can lead to better posture directly after having been performed which can be benifitial in allowing the muscles to recover in their correct positions. Stretching can also lead to better posture in the long term.";
        "mindTextStretching" = "Stretching is also an opportunity to actively relax the mind and train it to accept uncomfortable situations. Stretching is often not a pleasant experience to begin with, but as you stretch more it shifts from unpleasant, to acceptable, to practically enjoyable, thus is an excellent teacher for the mind. This shift is initiated by your mental state during the stretching, it is important to relax into the stretch, feeling and being completely aware of the sensation without forming any conscious opinions of it thus allowing it simply to be no more than a sensation (which your mind eventually gets used to). Realise that the discomfort is a result of a chemical reaction in your brain and body, and learn to control the effect of it on your mind. Relaxing into the stretch is done through breathing, breath in deeply, then relax and lean into the stretch as you breath out, repeat this until you are in a position where you have a deep stretch (that isn't forced), and continue breathing into the stretch, each breath out relaxing and accepting the sensation more.\nWhen you're stretching try not to put too much energy into any one thought, I find myself in a meditative state in which I watch my thoughts go by and am aware of everything around me (thoughts and physical space) without focusing on anything in particular.\nVisualisation of the muscles elongating can also be a good technique as this increases the mind muscle connection and allows you to relax the muscles better.\nStretching also improves the general health of your brain in the long term if performed consistenly and properly.\n\nNotes:\nIf you don't have time to stretch after your workout, perform at least 5min of light cardio for cool-down and try to stretch before bed.\nIt is important to note that caution is required and that you should stretch with good form and to your abilities. This avoids the possibitly of overstretching or stretchingx in such a way that does more harm than good. Don't force any stretch, this will not speed up your progress; hold the stretches in positions where you have good resistance, and when breathing out to increase the stretch only increase by tiny amounts and stop where you can stretch no furthur without forcing. Stop immeditely if pain or excessive discomfort become apparent (usually a sudden or sharp pain indicates an issue).\nWarming up before stand alone stretching sessions is important, this can take the form of 5min of light cardio or some dynamic stretches; the 'full-body' section under 'warm up' includes a warm up for stretching sessions.\nThe order in which you stretch is important, and the order presented here is thought out.\nThis section includes primarily static stretching where you hold in the maximum stretched position for a length of time, it is also possible to turn static stretches into isomeric stretches. An isomeric stretch is one in which you contract the muscle being stretched whilst in passive stretching position, then relaxing after 15s for 15-30s. Isomeric stretches can be useful as it stretches a greater portion of the muscle fibres in the muscle being stretched. They can however easily be done in a counterproductive manner, so I would only suggest them to people who already have had experience with them and understand a little about them. If you are interested in other stretching techniques, I suggest you look into PNF stretching (generally done with a partner) which is intermittent isomeric then static stretching and can lead to significant flexibility increases if done correctly.\nSelf massage is also a good technique during cooldown and stretching sessions.";
