"purposeTextStretching" = "The post-workout and post-cardio preset sessions are to be done directly after workouts and cardio respectively, they are important for cool-down and recovery. Other presets are to be done as stand-alone stretching sessions.\nPost-exercise stretching provides a moment to allow the heart rate to return to its resting state, and for the muscles and the mind to relax, it is important however to perform a light warm-down (cardio) before stretching.\nStretching in general can improve flexibility and mental health, reduce risk of injury, and improve circulation and muscle co-ordination. ";
"bodyTextStretching" = "Stretching the muscles that you have worked can aid recovery and muscle health; as you have been contracting the muscles throughout the exercise they have become shorter, tighter and remain somewhat contracted, therefore stretching them out relaxes them and restores their length. Stretching the muscles also aids blood circulation and thus muscle recovery. Unlike pre-exercise/warm-up stretching (that consists mainly of dynamic stretching), post-workout stretching is generally static as this provides time for the muscles to elongate.\nStretching is important not just post exercise, but also the next day and as stand alone sessions (these can take the form of yoga, but I have also included non yoga specific sessions in this stretching section).\nStretching can lead to better posture directly after having been performed which can be benefitial in allowing the muscles to recover in their correct positions. Stretching can also lead to better posture in the long term.";
"mindTextStretching" = "Stretching is also an opportunity to actively relax the mind and train it to accept uncomfortable situations. Stretching is often not a pleasant experience to begin with, but as you stretch more it shifts from unpleasant, to acceptable, to practically enjoyable, thus is an excellent teacher for the mind. This shift is initiated by your mental state during the stretching, it is important to relax into the stretch, feeling and being completely aware of the sensation without forming any conscious opinions of it thus allowing it simply to be no more than a sensation (which your mind eventually gets used to). Realise that the discomfort is a result of a chemical reaction in your brain and body, and learn to control the effect of it on your mind. Relaxing into the stretch is done through breathing, breathe in deeply, then relax and lean into the stretch as you breathe out, repeat this until you are in a position where you have a deep stretch (that isn't forced), and continue breathing into the stretch, each breathe out relaxing and accepting the sensation more.\nWhen you're stretching try not to put too much energy into any one thought, I find myself in a meditative state in which I watch my thoughts go by and am aware of everything around me (thoughts and physical space) without focusing on anything in particular.\nVisualisation of the muscles elongating can also be a good technique as this increases the mind muscle connection and allows you to relax the muscles better.\nStretching also improves the general health of your brain in the long term if performed consistenly and properly.\n\nNotes:\nIf you don't have time to stretch after your workout, perform at least 5min of light cardio for cool-down and try to stretch before bed.\nIt is important to note that caution is required and that you should stretch with good form and to your abilities. This avoids the possibitly of overstretching or stretchingx in such a way that does more harm than good. Don't force any stretch, this will not speed up your progress; hold the stretches in positions where you have good resistance, and when breathing out to increase the stretch only increase by tiny amounts and stop where you can stretch no further without forcing. Stop immeditely if pain or excessive discomfort become apparent (usually a sudden or sharp pain indicates an issue).\nWarming up before stand alone stretching sessions is important, this can take the form of 5min of light cardio or some dynamic stretches; the 'full-body' section under 'warm-up' includes a warm-up for stretching sessions.\nThe order in which you stretch is important, and the order presented here is thought out.\nThis section includes primarily static stretching where you hold in the maximum stretched position for a length of time, it is also possible to turn static stretches into isomeric stretches. An isomeric stretch is one in which you contract the muscle being stretched whilst in passive stretching position, then relaxing after 15s for 15-30s. Isomeric stretches can be useful as it stretches a greater portion of the muscle fibres in the muscle being stretched. They can however easily be done in a counterproductive manner, so I would only suggest them to people who already have had experience with them and understand a little about them. If you are interested in other stretching techniques, I suggest you look into PNF stretching (generally done with a partner) which is intermittent isomeric then static stretching and can lead to significant flexibility increases if done correctly.\nSelf massage is also a good technique during cooldown and stretching sessions.";

The choice of object changes the benefits of the meditation - for a relaxing meditation an natural object is a good choice; a tree, a mountain, a stream etc. Colours are also good to visualize.

It can be very useful in becoming more mindful throughout the day as it helps develop the ability to neutrally and calmly watch things without your brain chattering. Practicing this technique while walking can be good for beginners, as the object on which you are meditating changes continuously.\n\nThe technique also applies for sounds; observing a sound, for example the sound of trees in the wind, of a stream or of rain, can be extremely relaxing and help clear the mind.";

It can also increase your ability to focus as you are practicing the ability through the simple task of counting breaths.\n\nTo extend this technique you could use visualisation, imagining a progress bar that fills in as you get closer to the goal, or to visualise a counter of the number of breaths that increases each breath, without you actively saying the next number, rather simply seeing it (this is rather difficult and requires some practice).";

The goal can be anything, a workout, a run, stretching, getting a tough job done, literally anything. The key here is to have made an absolute decision to achieve this goal, and then to not force it in any way (i.e. not to have the feeling 'I have to'), simply to relax and have the confidence that we can achieve it, and watch our breath while we do exactly that (i.e. the feeling 'I will do'). It may take some practice to develop this skill, but once understood, it becomes our best friend.";

"effortCommitText" = "Fully committing means making a conscious, reasoned decision that you are going to achieve this goal.\n\nWhen making an effort the idea of giving up often enters your mind and you find yourself consciously thinking of the benefits that giving up would bring. Having fully committed you can remove the temptation of giving up; if the idea enters your mind no conscious thought need be put to considering it, you can simply drop it by giving your mind something else to focus on, like your breathing.\n\nA fatigued, strained or unmotivated mind requires simple, clear instructions to follow; having commited yourself to your goal you have given yourself exactly this, a simple, clear instruction.";

Not forcing means to avoid the thought 'I have to', simply relaxing and having the confidence that you can achieve it, i.e. to have the thought 'I will do'.\n\nMindfulness is an important skill when watching yourself make an effort to achieve the goal. In mindful meditation you remain aware of your breath, whilst allowing your attention to be taken by other thoughts and events in passing (like watching clouds drift by). It is important to always remain aware of your breath, and to return your focus to it whenever your mind wanders off.\n\nWhen making an effort to achieve your goal you can do exactly this, remain aware of your breath whilst allowing your mind to wander round different aspects of the act of achieving this goal. The key is to be aware but not discuss with yourself, for example if running, become aware of the feeling of the muscles in your legs, but don't tell yourself how uncomfortable it is. If any negative idea enters your mind, any distraction, return your focus entirely to your breath to clear the mind, thereby allowing yourself to put in maximal effort without straining.\n\nFocus on your breathing and allow yourself to give maximum effort, rather than focusing on giving maximum effort.";
