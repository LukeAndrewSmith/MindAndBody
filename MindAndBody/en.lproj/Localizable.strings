"purposeTextStretching" = "The post-workout and post-cardio preset sessions are to be done directly after workouts and cardio respectively, they are important for cool-down and recovery. Other presets are to be done as stand-alone stretching sessions.\nPost-exercise stretching provides a moment to allow the heart rate to return to its resting state, and for the muscles and the mind to relax, it is important however to perform a light warm-down (cardio) before stretching.\nStretching in general can improve flexibility and mental health, reduce risk of injury, and improve circulation and muscle co-ordination. ";
"bodyTextStretching" = "Stretching the muscles that you have worked can aid recovery and muscle health; as you have been contracting the muscles throughout the exercise they have become shorter, tighter and remain somewhat contracted, therefore stretching them out relaxes them and restores their length. Stretching the muscles also aids blood circulation and thus muscle recovery. Unlike pre-exercise/warm up stretching (that consists mainly of dynamic stretching), post-workout stretching is generally static as this provides time for the muscles to elongate.\nStretching is important not just post exercise, but also the next day and as stand alone sessions (these can take the form of yoga, but I have also included non yoga specific sessions in this stretching section).\nStretching can lead to better posture directly after having been performed which can be benefitial in allowing the muscles to recover in their correct positions. Stretching can also lead to better posture in the long term.";
"mindTextStretching" = "Stretching is also an opportunity to actively relax the mind and train it to accept uncomfortable situations. Stretching is often not a pleasant experience to begin with, but as you stretch more it shifts from unpleasant, to acceptable, to practically enjoyable, thus is an excellent teacher for the mind. This shift is initiated by your mental state during the stretching, it is important to relax into the stretch, feeling and being completely aware of the sensation without forming any conscious opinions of it thus allowing it simply to be no more than a sensation (which your mind eventually gets used to). Realise that the discomfort is a result of a chemical reaction in your brain and body, and learn to control the effect of it on your mind. Relaxing into the stretch is done through breathing, breathe in deeply, then relax and lean into the stretch as you breathe out, repeat this until you are in a position where you have a deep stretch (that isn't forced), and continue breathing into the stretch, each breathe out relaxing and accepting the sensation more.\nWhen you're stretching try not to put too much energy into any one thought, I find myself in a meditative state in which I watch my thoughts go by and am aware of everything around me (thoughts and physical space) without focusing on anything in particular.\nVisualisation of the muscles elongating can also be a good technique as this increases the mind muscle connection and allows you to relax the muscles better.\nStretching also improves the general health of your brain in the long term if performed consistenly and properly.\n\nNotes:\nIf you don't have time to stretch after your workout, perform at least 5min of light cardio for cool-down and try to stretch before bed.\nIt is important to note that caution is required and that you should stretch with good form and to your abilities. This avoids the possibitly of overstretching or stretchingx in such a way that does more harm than good. Don't force any stretch, this will not speed up your progress; hold the stretches in positions where you have good resistance, and when breathing out to increase the stretch only increase by tiny amounts and stop where you can stretch no furthur without forcing. Stop immeditely if pain or excessive discomfort become apparent (usually a sudden or sharp pain indicates an issue).\nWarming up before stand alone stretching sessions is important, this can take the form of 5min of light cardio or some dynamic stretches; the 'full-body' section under 'warm up' includes a warm up for stretching sessions.\nThe order in which you stretch is important, and the order presented here is thought out.\nThis section includes primarily static stretching where you hold in the maximum stretched position for a length of time, it is also possible to turn static stretches into isomeric stretches. An isomeric stretch is one in which you contract the muscle being stretched whilst in passive stretching position, then relaxing after 15s for 15-30s. Isomeric stretches can be useful as it stretches a greater portion of the muscle fibres in the muscle being stretched. They can however easily be done in a counterproductive manner, so I would only suggest them to people who already have had experience with them and understand a little about them. If you are interested in other stretching techniques, I suggest you look into PNF stretching (generally done with a partner) which is intermittent isomeric then static stretching and can lead to significant flexibility increases if done correctly.\nSelf massage is also a good technique during cooldown and stretching sessions.";

If you are flexible enough and have a strong lower back then this can be a good stretch.\nI present an alternative that uses isomeric stretching (activate the muscle for a period of time in the stretch then relax):.\nStand upright with good posture and an active core.\nBreak at the hips and bend forwards, keeping your back perfectly straight and knees straight.\nLower yourself to the deepest stretch you can reach with a straight back, feeling your lower back with your hands to ensure it's straight.\nFor many people this won't even be close to parallel with the ground, don't fool yourself and go lower with a bent back, work to your limits.\nRelax your arms down in front of you or stretch them up above your head to increase the stretch.\nConcentrate on activating the hamstrings during the stretch, and hold for the recommended amount of time.\nReturn to standing and relax, pausing for 5s, then repeat for the recommended amount of sets.\n\nNotes:\nThis exercise can also be performed with very light weights if you want to get an even better contraction in the hamstrings.\nDon't allow your back to bend at all during the stretch, keeping it straight whilst concentrating on activating the hamstrings.\nBreathe into the hamstrings.";

You should feel a good stretch in the quad.\nHold for the recommended amount of time then repeat with the other leg.\n\nNotes:\nPut your foot at a height on the wall that allows you to get a good stretch in the quad.\nRotate your pelvis forwards to increase the stretch.\nBreathe into the quad.";
"quadStretchE" = "Stretch:\nA simple standing quad stretch where you you hold your heel at your glute is hard to perform without overly bending your lower back and aleiviating the stretch in the quad. If you can comfortably do it standing without rounding the lower back then do so, if not perform it lying down.:\nLie on your left side with your left arm above your head and your knees and hips pointing at 90º in front of you.\nHold the front of your right ankle/foot with your right hand, hold your heel at your glute and extend the right knee away from your and back to try and get your thigh in line with your torso.\nActively keep a straight lower back when doing this.\nHold for the recommended amount of time then repeat with the other leg.\n\nNotes:\nDon't rotate your torso.\nKeep your hips rotated forwards.\nBreathe into your quad.";

Practicing this technique while walking can be good for beginners, as the object on which you are meditating changes continuously.\n\nThe technique also applies for sounds; observing a sound, for example the sound of trees in the wind, of a stream or of rain, can be extremely relaxing and help clear the mind.";

It can also increase your ability to focus as you are practicing the ability through the simple task of counting breaths.\n\nTo extend this technique you could use visualisation, imagining a progress bar that fills in as you get closer to the goal, or to visualise a counter of the number of breaths that increases each breath, without you actively saying the next number, rather simply seeing it (this is rather difficult and requires some practice).";

There is a skill to be learned in setting ourselves a goal, deciding without question to achieve it so that we are fully committed, then simply being aware of our breathing and allowing ourselves to give maximum effort and achieve this goal. The goal can be anything, a workout, a run, stretching, getting a tough job done, literally anything. The key here is to have made an absolute decision to achieve this goal, and then to not force it in any way (i.e. not to have the feeling 'I have to'), simply to relax and have the confidence that we can achieve it, and watch our breath while we do exactly that (i.e. the feeling 'I will do'). It may take some practice to develop this skill, but once understood, it becomes our best friend.";

Having fully committed you can remove the temptation of giving up; if the idea enters your mind no conscious thought need be put to considering it, you can simply drop it by giving your mind something else to focus on, like your breathing.\n\nA fatigued, strained or unmotivated mind requires simple, clear instructions to follow; having commited yourself to your goal you have given yourself exactly this, a simple, clear instruction.";

In mindful meditation you remain aware of your breath, whilst allowing your attention to be taken by other thoughts and events in passing (like watching clouds drift by). It is important to always remain aware of your breath, and to return your focus to it whenever your mind wanders off.\n\nWhen making and effort to achieve your goal you can do exactly this, remain aware of your breath whilst allowing your mind to wander round different aspects of the act of acheiving this goal. The key is to be aware but not discuss with yourself, for example if running, become aware of the feeling of the muscles in your legs, but don't tell yourself how uncomfortable it is.

Become aware of how you feel the stretch in different body parts, how your body relaxes into the pose as your mind relaxes into your breath and how your breath helps you keep good posture.\nTry not to analyse the feeling of each pose with words, just become aware of the physical feeling and breathe into each pose.";
