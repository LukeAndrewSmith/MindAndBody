With each new set, move the foam roller furthur up your thoracic spine 10-15cm or to another position that seems fit (that feels it could benifit from stretching).\n\nNotes:\nKeep your neck in a comfortable neutral position.\n\nYour arms can be in any position (where your elbows are in front of your chest not out to the side) that does not cause pain or discomfort, here are some suggestions:\n- With your palms facing towards you and your hand touching, bring your elows close together and place your palms just behind the top of your head so that your elbows are close to your forehead (without pulling your head up with your arms)\n- Hold your elbows or your shoulders and point your elbows up, perpendicular to your chest.\n- Place your hands somewhere on your chest area and relax your elbows so they are close to your torso.\n\n\nPurpose:\nFoam rolling loosens the muscles and warms them up in preperation for the warmup and exercise, it also increases blood flow to the rolled area.

        "catCowE" = "Movement:\nPosition yourself on your hands and knees, with you hands directly under your shoulders and knees directly under your hips, and ensure equal weight distribution across your hands and knees.\nSlowly drop your stomach towards the floor and arch your upper and lower back whilst allowing your hips to open (cow pose), if you can do so comfortably look up towards the ceiling and draw your shoulders down away from your ears. Hold for 1s then return gently to the starting position.\nProceed to slowly round your back up towards the ceiling and relax the back of your neck so your head stretches towards the ground (cat pose) without forcing it towards your chin, gravity will do the work. Hold for 1s then return gently to the starting position.\n1 rep is 1 cat and 1 cow.\nYour neck should be that last to move during this movement, the movement should start from the tailbone.\nThe movement should flow nicely and not be jolty.\nDon't force the stretch in the maximum positions, stretch to a comfortable extent.\n\n\nPurpose:\nThe cat cow warms up the entire spine and increases its range of motion.";
