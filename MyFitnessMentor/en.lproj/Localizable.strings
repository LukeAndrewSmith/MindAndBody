A warmup should be consistently performed before exercise; for workouts it should be 15-20min long (a longer warmup coupled with a shorter workout is more effective than the inverse), for cardio it should be 10-15min long. In both cases the warmup should produce mild sweating, and increased mental and physical focus.";
