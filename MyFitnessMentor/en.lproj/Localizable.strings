Each set move the foam roller furthur up your thoracic spine 10-15cm or to another position that seems fit.\nKeep your neck in a comfortable neutral position.\nYour arms can be in any position (where your elbows are in front of your chest not out to the side) that does not cause pain or discomfort, here are some suggestions:\n- Put your hands and elows together and (so your elbows are in front of your face) and place your hand just behind the top of your head (without pulling your head up)\n- Hold your elbows or your shoulders and point your elbows at a 90º angle away from your chest.\n- Place your hands somewhere on your chest area and relax your elbows so they are close to your torso.\n\n\nPurpose:\nFoam rolling loosens the muscles and warms them up in preperation for the warmup, it also increases blood flow to the rolled area.
