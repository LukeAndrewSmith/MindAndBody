Also make sure to keep a neutral head position and don't let it drop towards the floor.\nIn the protraction, attempt to push the scapula round the ribcage and bring them as far out as comfortably possible.\nThis movement can also be done in the kneeling pushup position.\n\n\nPurpose:\nScapula pushups help improve your posture during the workout to come, they warm up your serratus anterior (the muscles that control the scapula) and also increase the range of motion of both shoulders an scapula.";
